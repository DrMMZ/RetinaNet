# RetinaNet for Object Detection

[RetinaNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) is an efficient one-stage object detector trained with the focal loss. This repository is a TensorFlow2 implementation of RetinaNet and its applications, aiming for creating a tool in object detection task that can be easily extended to other datasets or used in building projects. It includes

1. source code of RetinaNet and its configuration;
2. source code of data (RetinaNet's inputs) generator using multiple CPU cores; 
3. source code of utilities such as image/mask preprocessing, augmetation, average precision (AP) metric, visualization and so on;
4. jupyter notebook demonstration using RetinaNet in training and real-time detection on some datasets. 

### Applications

The following are example detections, randomly selected from un-trained images.

1. My own dataset, *empty returns operations (ERO)*, is a collection of images such that each contains empty beer, wine and liquor cans or bottles in densely packed scenes that can be returned for refunds. The goal is to count the number of returns fast and accurately, instead of manually checking by human (specially for some people like me who is bad on counting). The dataset (as of July 15 2021) consists of 47 labeled cellphone images in cans, variety of positions.

2. The [SKU-110K](https://github.com/eg4000/SKU110K_CVPR19) dataset, focusing on detection in densely packed scenes. Indeed, our ERO detection above used transfer learning from SKU-110K.

3. The [nuclei](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018) dataset, identifying the cellsâ€™ nuclei.
